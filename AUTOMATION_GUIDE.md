# Automation Guide

This portfolio website includes automated scripts to manage gallery photos and track changes.

## Gallery Photo Management

### Overview
The gallery automatically displays all photos from the `assets/gallery/` folder without manual code updates.

### Adding New Photos

1. **Add your photos** to the `assets/gallery/` folder:
   ```bash
   cp my-photo.jpg assets/gallery/
   ```

2. **Run the generator script**:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-gallery
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   node generate-gallery-list.js
   ```

3. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add assets/gallery/
   git commit -m "Add new gallery photos"
   git push
   ```

### Supported Image Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`
- `.webp`
- `.svg`

### How It Works
1. The `generate-gallery-list.js` script scans the `assets/gallery/` folder
2. It creates/updates `assets/gallery/photos.json` with a list of all image files
3. The website loads this JSON file and displays all photos in the gallery carousel

## Changelog & Last Updated

### Overview
The website footer displays when the site was last updated and provides a changelog of recent changes.

### Updating the Changelog

Run the changelog generator:
```bash
npm run generate-changelog
```

Or:
```bash
node generate-changelog.js
```

This fetches all merged pull requests from GitHub and creates/updates `changelog.json`.

**Note:** For authenticated GitHub API access (higher rate limits), set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run generate-changelog
```

### Update Both at Once

To update both the gallery and changelog:
```bash
npm run generate-all
```

## Workflow Recommendations

### When Adding New Content

1. Add photos to `assets/gallery/`
2. Update both gallery and changelog:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-all
   ```
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update gallery and changelog"
   git push
   ```

### Before Deploying

Always run the generators before deploying to ensure everything is up to date:
```bash
npm run generate-all
git add .
git commit -m "Update generated files"
git push
```

## Files Generated

| File | Purpose | Generated By |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `assets/gallery/photos.json` | List of gallery photos | `generate-gallery-list.js` |
| `changelog.json` | Recent changes from merged PRs | `generate-changelog.js` |

**Important:** Both JSON files should be committed to the repository so they're available when the site is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Troubleshooting

### Gallery not showing photos?
1. Check that photos are in `assets/gallery/`
2. Verify `photos.json` exists and contains your photos
3. Re-run: `npm run generate-gallery`
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Changelog not loading?
1. Check that `changelog.json` exists
2. Re-run: `npm run generate-changelog`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Permission errors when running scripts?
Make scripts executable (Unix/Linux/Mac):
```bash
chmod +x generate-gallery-list.js generate-changelog.js
```

## Manual Editing (Not Recommended)

While you can manually edit `photos.json` and `changelog.json`, it's not recommended as your changes will be overwritten the next time the scripts run. Always use the generator scripts instead.
